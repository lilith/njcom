# What I'm About

In the decade following my "technology loyalist" phase, I used a different programming language and framework for *every major project I undertook*. I continue to seek out better tools every day. When they don't exist, I create them. Read [War On Waste](/blog/2013/war-on-waste) for more insight into why I'm focused on developer libraries and tools.

Given limited resources, thinking 'small' can let you have a greater effect on the world. There is great value in preserving developer flow and eliminating leaky abstractions.
