# About Me

I've been writing software for nearly a decade. This doesn't make me anything special - there are far, far more experienced people out there.

However, I'm a little obsessed with ROI. Return on investment of *my time.* So I'm perpetually looking for better tools, better languages, and better frameworks.  Most importantly, I'm always looking for better *concepts*, approaches and practices.

Along the way, I've learned to classic 'wisdom' about software, and develop different viewpoints by trying to be a detached observer. 

All software sucks, but some software sucks less.

I try to build software that sucks less.
