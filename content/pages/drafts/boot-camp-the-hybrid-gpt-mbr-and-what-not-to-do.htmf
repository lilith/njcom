<h1>Boot Camp, the hybrid GPT/MBR , and what *NOT* to do</h1>

I have a MacBook Pro with a 320GB drive (300GiB). I have OS X installed on the first 150GiB, Vista on the next 100GiB, and Ubuntu on the last 50GiB.

My drive started the click of death about a month ago, and I started seeing system freezes. I backed everything up in a hurry and left on vacation. I'm back now, and I have a brand new 500GB drive to replace it with.

So... now the question is how to move my partitions over the the new drive and expand my OS X partition.

SRC

&gt; dd_rescue /dev/sda /dev/sdb - Note, the GPT will have incorrect information about the drive's size. No tools will work until this is fixed.

&gt; wizard

&gt;terminal

&gt;parted

&gt;print

&gt;type "fix" when prompted to fix the GPT

&gt; Click GParted

Click the last 3 partitions (including linux swap)

copy the value from Free Space Following into Free Space Preceding, click Free Space Following to make it enter 0, and click Move

If you have any filesystem errors on any of the drives (I did on the NTFS parition), GParted will stop right there (it works on the partitions right-to-left).

My solution was to delete the NTFS partition and create a new one where I wanted it moved to. I then used dd_rescue again to copy the filesystem over again for just that partition.

Unfortunately, creation occurred before the deletion, and got numbered 6 instead of 3 in the partition table. Therefore gptsync (part of rEFIt) wouldn't put it in the MBR.

So... I opened GParted, wrote down the start/end sector numbers, and deleted it. I then opened parted from the command line and ran

mkpart primary ntfs 651612465s 865052054s  (the Ss are needed to tell it we are using sectors).

At which point it reappeared as sd3 again... yay.

I ran gptsync from rEFIt, and it now made it into the top-4 list for the MBR... however, it was marked as C0 (unknown) instead of 07 (NTFS/HPFS) And the asterisk was on the linux partition instead of the ntfs partition.

Since rEFIt is directing the partition to boot from, it still would probably been fine... except for the Vista's boot configuration store.

Attempts to boot resulted in "An error occurred while attempting to read the boot configuration data."

Like this guy's attempts: <a href="http://dreamlayers.blogspot.com/2008/02/manually-moving-vista-ntfs-partition.html">http://dreamlayers.blogspot.com/2008/02/manually-moving-vista-ntfs-partition.html</a>

heat related lock-ups?

In addition, I needed to mark it as a system boot partition.

Don't spend $49 on Acrons Disk Director. It locks up at the boot menu on my MacBook Pro with bootcamp installed.

Dont's spend $69 on Symantec Partition Magic. Don't ever boot from the Partition Magic 8 disk with boot camp installed. It automagically destroys the hybrid gpt/mbr without any user intervention. OS X may repair your first partition, but you'll probably have to use forensic tools to find the geometry for the remainder.

If you're interested in more than your OS X partition, don't use CarbonCopyCloner or probably any other desktop-based tool to clone your drive. I don't believe any currently exist to handle a

Use those nice free bootable linux CDs. You'll have to run rEFIt parition sync (if you're doing a 3-way bootcamp you probably already installed it), or use gptsync afterwards. Clonezilla and SystemRestoreCD both include dd_rescue, which is by far the simplest way to clone one drive to another. It's pretty fast, even over a USB link. Expect 2-3 hours for a 320MB system.
<h2>Fixing the partition offset</h2>
I tried 0xED and HexFiend, nether allowed direct disk editing.

So... thankfully it's easy to copy a section of the hard disk to a file

I executed "sudo dd if=/dev/disk0s3 count=500 of=vistabootpart"

Which placed a vistabootpart file in my home directory with 250KiB  of the 3rd partition (2nd if you don't count the EFI partition) on my first hard drive.

I then opened it up in OxED and selected 4 bytes starting at 1C.

The 32-but signed value is the number you're looking at - this should match the sector offset of the partition. Mine was 314982440/0x2840C612

I changed it to 651612465, the new location of the partition.

To save the file, I first had to change permissions (Cmd+I in finder), unlock, and give staff and everyone read/write instead of just read. I think this is because I used sudo to write the file under elevated priviledges (which are required for disk-level access).

I then ran dd again, just switching if and of:

sudo dd if=vistabootpart count=500 of=/dev/disk0s3

After this, Vista appeared to start booting up.... then croaked "autochk not found - AUTOCHK program" and subsequently bluescreened.

Reading http://www.pcguide.com/vb/showthread.php?t=45339

led me to believe this was because I wasn't able to choose the right partition type in the GPT (and subsequently the MBR).

Orginially the GPT type was Basic Data and the MBR type was 0x07 NTFS/HPFS - however, recreating in parted changed it to MS Reserved 0xC0.

Running the Vista repair disk marked the partition active.

I'm tired of rebooting by now, so I found an OS X version of gptsync

http://netkas.org/?p=39

Download http://rapidshare.com/files/73933573/gptsync_tools.zip.html

I dropped the executables in my home directory.

I ran "sudo ./showpart /dev/disk0" to see my gpt and mbr tables.

MS Reserved is getting translated to 0xC0....

Which I think is being interpreted as a hidden partiton by Vista, causing my boot problems.

According to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table

MS Reserved = E3C9E316-0B5C-4DB8-817D-F92DF00215AE

Basic Data Partition = <span> </span>EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7

So... I'm going to head back to the System Rescue CD and see if I can fix this...

Trying to boot from the vista disk generated the same error...

Sounds like it's time for me to get BartPE+Partition saving running..
Grabbed my XPSP2 disk... so far it's building away... downloading partsaving and added it as a plugin.
I burned the resulting ISO with InfraRecorder... and viola! it booted.

BartPE ran great - partition saving allowed me to edit the Vista Boot Configuration on paritition 3 and edit all the BCD entries to point to the right sectors.

Didn't help, even though some wrong.

I held down the option key while booting, and booted the vista DVD that way... seemed to work. Not sure why rEFIt stopped working....

I hit repair and Vista detected a problem with my startup partition. Repair and restart solved the problem with winload.exe!
