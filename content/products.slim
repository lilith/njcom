h1 Open-source software

markdown:
  Most of my projects are on Github, but they are split between [github.com/nathanaeljones](http://github.com/nathanaeljones) and [github.com/imazen](http://github.com/imazen).

h4 lightresize
a href="https://github.com/imazen/lightresize" lightresize is an embeddable .NET class for primitive image resizing which doesn't depend on System.Web - but also lacks 95% of ImageResizer functionality.

  Nesta is one of the best micro-CMSes, and I've contributed a lot to the project.

| These projects are no longer actively developed, but still quite stable and usable.

h4 SuperCopy
