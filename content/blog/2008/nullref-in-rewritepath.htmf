<h1>NullReferenceException in RewritePath</h1>

<p>If you are getting a NullReferenceException from RewritePath at ~/, or if image references break when your URLs end in /, you need hotfix <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/911300">911300</a> or a subsequent update such as MS06-056.</p>
<p>I debugged this problem with MaxmimumASP about a year ago. Apparently, this patch comes with Visual Studio SP1, but wasn't released for the rest of the world (read: production servers) until several months later. Some hosts may still be missing the patch, so watch out.</p>

This happened when trying to rewrite http://domain.org/ to page http://domain.org/default.aspx. It's a pretty common scenario. Now, while subfolders such as http://domain.org/blog/ didn't throw an error, ASP.NET translated all of the image and hyperlink references incorrectly. But URLs ending in a non-slash character behaved fine.</p>
<p>There's a bit <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=276542">more information</a> on the issue on Microsoft Connect, although I don't mention the subfolder issue.</p>
<p>Bottom line: If you see different behavior between dev and production, ask your hosting provider to update the ASP.NET runtime. I know mine (and others) test .NET patches for quite a while before installing them, since they often cause as many problems as they fix. Don't believe them if they say it's up-to-date. Get the *full* version number on System.Web.dll and compare it to yours. </p>
