# A Year and Change

It's been over a year since my last blog post. I can place some of the blame on Wordpress, for having endless issues each time I update it, but mostly it's my own fault.
Over a year ago, I decided to migrate from Wordpress to a simple git-based CMS called Nesta. However, the task being near the bottom of my TODO-list meant it stayed half-finished so long that I grew frustrated with Nesta (from using it on imageresizing.net) before I even got it migrated. 

This started me on another journey; namely building a better CMS than Nesta. Nesta's idea was sound, but the implementation was poor and the abstractions leaky. I developed [Hardwired](http://hardwiredcms.com), and finished the migration.
